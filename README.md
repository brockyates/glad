# glad

I use glad as my OpenGL loading library (https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Loading_Library) in my personal projects.

This repo contains the library files for all GL entry points, which were created by the glad loader-generator utility at https://glad.dav1d.de/.

I've also added premake to facilitate bringing glad into my own projects.
